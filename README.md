# airbnb-clone-project
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project goals
User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Tech Stack

•	GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
•	Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
•	Redis: Used for caching and session management.
•	Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
•	CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design
Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, and Payments.
A user can have multiple properties, a booking belongs to a property. 
A user can write multiple reviews, a review belongs to one property.
A user can make multiple payments. A payment is linked to one booking.
A booking has one payment.
A property have multiple reviews.
A booking is for one user.

## Feature Breakdown
API Documentation, user authentication, property management, booking system, payment processing, review system and database optimization.
1. API Documentation
API documentation provides clear instructions on how frontend and third-party services can interact with the backend system. It defines available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication methods, ensuring smooth integration and easier collaboration among developers.
2. User Authentication
User authentication ensures secure access to the platform by allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage sessions using tokens or cookies. This is essential for protecting user data and enabling personalized experiences like bookings, reviews, and property listings.
3. Property Management
This feature allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings, including details like location, pricing, and availability. It empowers users to showcase their spaces and is central to the core functionality of the platform.

4. Booking System
The booking system enables guests to reserve properties for specific dates while preventing double bookings through availability checks. It tracks reservation details, making it possible to manage stay durations, calculate costs, and support cancellations or changes.

5. Payment Processing
Payment processing securely handles transactions between guests and hosts, including charging, refunds, and status tracking. It ensures trust and smooth financial operations, typically integrating with third-party payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.

6. Review System
The review system allows users to leave feedback on properties after their stay, including ratings and comments. It builds trust within the platform, helps improve host accountability, and assists future guests in making informed booking decisions.

7. Database Optimization
Database optimization involves indexing, query tuning, and data structuring to improve performance and scalability. It ensures the application runs efficiently, especially as the user base, bookings, and property data grow.
